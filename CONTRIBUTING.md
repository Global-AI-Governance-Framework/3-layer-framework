# Contributing to the Three-Layer AI Governance Framework

First off, thank you for considering contributing to this framework! It is through community feedback and diverse perspectives that we can build a more robust model for global AI governance.

We welcome contributions from researchers, policymakers, developers, and AI ethicists.

## 🌟 How You Can Help

You can contribute in several ways:

1.  **Refining the Layers:** Suggest improvements to the definitions of the Infrastructure, Logical, and Social layers.
2.  **Mapping Actors:** Help us identify and place international bodies, NGOs, or regulatory acts within the correct layers.
3.  **Proposing Verticals:** Identify emerging trends (like Autonomous Agents) that span across multiple layers.
4.  **Case Studies:** Provide real-world examples of how this framework can be applied to specific geopolitical or technical challenges.

## 🛠️ The Process
