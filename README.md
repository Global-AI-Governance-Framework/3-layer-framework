# Understanding Global AI Governance Through a Three-Layer Framework

Welcome to the official repository for the **Three-Layer Framework for Global AI Governance**.

This project proposes a multi-layered framework to conceptualize and navigate the complex, fragmented landscape of global AI policy. Inspired by the classic 3-layer model of internet governance, we adapt this structure to address the unique challenges of the AI ecosystem.

## 📑 Overview
The rapid growth of AI policy initiatives (such as the Pax Silica Initiative and the Agentic AI Foundation) has created a risk of duplication, overlap, and interoperability challenges. Our framework aims to:

* **Provide a common taxonomy** for policymakers and researchers.
* **Identify key actors** and international bodies at each level of the AI stack.
* **Enable targeted policy solutions** that anticipate spillover effects across layers.

## 🏗️ The Three Layers
Our framework categorizes AI activity into three distinct layers:

1. **The Infrastructure Layer:** The physical foundation, including semiconductors (GPUs, TPUs), data centers, cloud platforms, and energy systems.
2. **The Logical Layer:** The software, proprietary and open-source foundation models, frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and interoperability protocols (e.g., MCP).
3. **The Social Layer:** Human and institutional interactions where AI applications (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) are used for content creation, B2B, and G2C services.

> **Note:** Ethical considerations are treated as a cross-cutting topic that permeates every layer, rather than a separate category.

## 🚀 Why This Framework?
The visualization helps clarify which regulations (like the EU AI Act or California’s Transparency in Frontier AI Act) target specific layers and identifies emerging **"cross-layer verticals"** like autonomous agents and training data. It also addresses the geopolitical challenges of AI governance and the need for agile, data-driven policy.

## 🤝 Open Invitation for Collaboration
This framework is a starting point, not a definitive framing. As the AI field is inherently dynamic, we invite the community to:

* **Suggest refinements** to the layers.
* **Update the mapping** of international bodies.
* **Propose additional layers** (e.g., a "physical-AI systems" layer or a "raw materials" layer).

## 📝 How to Contribute
We welcome contributions that enhance the robustness and accuracy of this framework.

* **Open an Issue:** To discuss potential changes or observations.
* **Submit a Pull Request:** To propose direct edits to the framework documentation.
