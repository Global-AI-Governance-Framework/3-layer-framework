# Understanding Global AI Governance Through a Three-Layer Framework

Welcome to the official repository for the **Three-Layer Framework for Global AI Governance**. 

This project proposes a multi-layered framework to conceptualize and navigate the complex, fragmented landscape of global AI policy. Inspired by the classic 3-layer model of internet governance, we adapt this structure to address the unique challenges of the AI ecosystem.

## 📑 Overview
The rapid growth of AI policy initiatives (such as the Pax Silica Initiative and the Agentic AI Foundation) has created a risk of duplication, overlap, and interoperability challenges. Our framework aims to:

* **Provide a common taxonomy** for policymakers and researchers.
* **Identify key actors** and international bodies at each level of the AI stack.
* **Enable targeted policy solutions** that anticipate spillover effects across layers.

## 🏗️ The Three Layers
Our framework categorizes AI activity into three distinct layers:

1. **The Infrastructure Layer:** The physical foundation, including semiconductors (GPUs, TPUs), data centers, cloud platforms, and energy systems.
2. **The Logical Layer:** The software, proprietary and open-source foundation models, frameworks (PyTorch, TensorFlow), and interoperability protocols (e.g., MCP).
3. **The Social Layer:** Human and institutional interactions where AI applications (ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.) are used for content creation, B2B, and G2C services.

> **Note:** Ethical considerations are treated as a cross-cutting topic that permeates every layer, rather than a separate category.
